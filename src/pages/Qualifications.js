		<h2>Résumé</h2>
		<p>
			My résumé is available <a href="../Resume.pdf">here TODO THIS NEEDS TO BE UPDATED</a>. Feel free to reach out to
			me with any questions or other details! My longer term aspiration is to do research in quantum information theory,
			but I currently develop software at Amazon Web Services.
		</p>
		<h2>Academic</h2>
		<p>TODO: explain my interests, my background/experience, and potentially anything else that may be interesting.</p>
		<h2>Professional</h2>
		<p>TODO: explain my work experience and impacts and anything else that may be interesting.</p>
		<h2>Languages</h2>
		<p>
			One of my life goals is to be proficient in Spanish, French, Hindi, and Japanese in addition to English. I believe
			I am capable enough in Spanish to claim that I am able to speak it as a second language, but I am still focusing
			on learning it for now. Once I am satisfied with my command of Spanish, I will shift the bulk of my focus onto
			French. I currently have some grasp of French. As for Hindi and Japanese, I know not much beyond the basics.
		</p>
		<p>I love practicing languages with others, so don&apos;t hesitate to reach out!</p>
