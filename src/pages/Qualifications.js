		<h2>Résumé</h2>
		<p>
			My résumé is available <a href="../Resume.pdf">here</a>. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or other
			details!
		</p>
		<h2>Programming</h2>
		<p>
			I love programming! The only limits of software are those imposed by hardware, math, and, most importantly, the
			developer&apos;s imagination. I am most interested in computability and complexity.
		</p>
		<p>
			I host most of my projects on <a href="https://www.github.com/SaurabhTotey">GitHub</a>. I have developed a variety
			of different applications. I have experience with game development, full-stack, simulations, scripting, scientific
			software, and robotics.
		</p>
		<h2>Physics</h2>
		<p>
			I think physics is really cool because it is a science dealing with the fundamental realities of the universe. I
			am most interested in quantum information and cosmology.
		</p>
		<h2>Music</h2>
		<p>
			I play the piano and cello as a hobby. I enjoy practicing music from TV shows or videogames that I feel I have an
			emotional connection with.
		</p>
		<h2>Languages</h2>
		<p>
			I find the process of learning languages really satisfying. I speak English natively. I am proficient with Spanish
			and am gaining proficiency with French. I hope to gain proficiency with more languages once I master Spanish and
			French.
