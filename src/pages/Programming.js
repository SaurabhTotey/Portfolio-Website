		<p>
			Sorry, this page is a work in progress! Right now, this page is just a skeleton for what I will put here.
			Eventually, I will include links to relevant projects.
		</p>
		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>
			My <a href={"https://www.github.com/SaurabhTotey"}>GitHub</a> has the majority of my projects. I will showcase my
			favorite programming projects in this section.
		</p>
		<h2>Skills</h2>
		<h4>Graphics</h4>
		<p>
			I have experience with many graphics APIs. I have intermediate knowledge of APIs like Vulkan and WebGPU, but I
			also have experience with other libraries like LibSDL2 and LibGDX. On the web, I have experience using canvas
			rendering contexts.
		</p>
		<h4>Full-Stack</h4>
		<p>
			I am comfortable working on any part of a web stack. I have worked on both backends, frontends, and everything in
			between. I also have experience using database technologies like MySQL and PostgreSQL.
		</p>
		<h4>Simulations</h4>
		<p>
			I am very comfortable with writing simulations. I have written simulations as both personal projects and as a part
			of the PhET Simulations team. Most of my simulations simulate physical processes or demonstrate basic mathematical
			conecpts.
		</p>
		<h4>Scripting</h4>
		<p>I have written many scripts for many different utilities. I mainly use bash for scripting for portability.</p>
		<h4>Scientific Software</h4>
		<p>
			Apart from simulations, I have worked Python libraries like SageMath, NumPy, Pandas, and MatPlotLib, as well as
			languages like Mathematica to perform work or analyses on scientific datasets.
		</p>
		<h4>Robotics</h4>
		<p>
			In high school, I was a part of our school&apos;s FIRST robotics team, where I worked on various programming (and
			other) tasks.
		</p>
		<h4>Math</h4>
		<p>
			I feel very confident in my math skills. Specifically, I feel strong in my linear algebra and calculus abilities.
			I have extensive experience with numerical integrators like Euler-steps and Runge-Kuttas.
		</p>
		<h2>Programming Languages</h2>
		<p>
			I enjoy languages that have functional features, but I am also skilled in object-oriented programming. I often
			combine both styles of programming. I generally try to write declarative code whenever possible because I find
			well-written declarative code is also more readable.
		</p>
		<p>
			My favorite languages are Rust and Kotlin. I like Rust because, for my use cases, it often allows me to not write
			C/C++ but still provide much of the same functionality and then some. I like Kotlin because it has really nice
			syntactic sugar and shortcuts for common programming tasks, and it just feels really comfortable to use.
		</p>
		<h2>Setup</h2>
		<h4>Version Control</h4>
		<p>
			I am extremely familiar with Git. I rarely start a project without initializing a Git repository for it because I
			rely on the safety that it provides in version control.
		</p>
		<h4>Editor</h4>
		<p>
			I do most of my programming in NeoVim (with my configurations available{" "}
			<a href="https://github.com/SaurabhTotey/Configs/blob/main/configs/NeoVim/init.vim">here</a>). I have experience
			using other editors too, such as Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ Idea, WebStorm, CLion, and other JetBrains IDEs. I
			now mostly use NeoVim because it is free and open-source, and so I know that I will be able to use it forever.
		</p>
		<h4>Computer Setup</h4>
		<p>
			For all my non-gaming needs, I am running Arch linux with all my configurations available on{" "}
			<a href="https://www.github.com/SaurabhTotey/Configs">this GitHub repository</a>.
