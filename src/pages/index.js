I wish D had more support with external libraries, because it really is a very pleasant language to work in. One of the only complaints I have with the language itself is that it has very cryptic error messages that make it hard to debug."

I love so many aspects of this show, such as how the story is one continuous stream of events, or how each character really does grow, even after they have achieved their \"main goals\". My favorite part of this show is near the ending where there is a consistent theme of humans becoming crueler and more like monsters while the literal monsters start gaining more emotions and becoming more human. My only gripe about this show is that it has a slow start, which makes it impossible to convince others to watch this show far enough to actually enjoy it."

I couldn't be more wrong. Watching this show felt like I was watching torture taking place. The protagonist undergoes so much trouble, and the fact that the protagonist cannot tell anyone about the problems that he has to face alone is what really makes his situations feel unfair. I really like how this story is one of failure and then redemption: the protagonist repeatedly fails to take actions in a sane way and then gets punished for it, but he ends up having to redeem himself for his failures."

This show was extremely captivating the entire way through, and really knew how to make a great ending that tied everything together.
