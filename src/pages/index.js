I currently live in Boulder, Colorado with my parents and my younger brother. In my free time, I spend a lot of my time trying to learn. My main passions are science and technology, but more specifically, I love learning all sorts of things such as programming, playing the piano, playing the cello, and modelling 3D objects. However, that isn't to say that I don't spend some of my free time doing other activities such as playing videogames or watching television series. I hope one day to make a great change in the world.</p>
