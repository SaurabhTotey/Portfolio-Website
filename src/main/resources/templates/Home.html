            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p class="normalText">Hello, I am Saurabh Totey. I live in Boulder, Colorado. I was born here on December
                5th, 2000, but I lived in Boston for a few years. Currently, I attend Fairview Highschool. During and
                after school, I attend clubs such as Code Club, Math Club, Future Business Leaders of America, NACLO,
                Robotics, Stock Market Club, and Speech and Debate. In my freetime, I enjoy reading, playing videogames,
                watching various TV shows, practicing the piano and cello, and coding. Some things that I am currently
                trying to learn include computer networking, computer threading, digital art, and machine learning.</p>
