            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p class="normalText">Hello, I am Saurabh Totey. I live in Boulder, Colorado. I was born here on December
                5th, 2000, but I lived in Boston for a few years. Currently, I attend Fairview Highschool. During and
                after school, I attend clubs such as Code Club, Math Club, Future Business Leaders of America, NACLO,
                Robotics, Stock Market Club, and Speech and Debate. In my freetime, I enjoy reading, playing videogames,
                watching various TV shows, practicing the piano and cello, and coding. I have an interest in learning
                more math, physics, and programming. My goal for the near future is to try and blend all of those
                aspects together to make a game. However, for the long term, I still don't know what I would like to do
                with my life.</p>
