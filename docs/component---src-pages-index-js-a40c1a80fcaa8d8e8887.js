I am Saurabh Totey. Welcome to my little space on the internet. I am a human male (he/him/his) that is ",new Date(new Date-new Date(2e3,12,5)).getFullYear()-1970," years old. I am currently studying physics and computer science at the undergraduate level at the University of Colorado at Boulder. My main passions are science and technology, but I love learning about all sorts of things such as programming, playing the piano, playing the cello, and modelling 3D objects. However, that isn't to say that I don't spend some of my free time doing other activities such as playing videogames or watching television series. I hope one day to make a great change in the world.")),l.a.createElement(o.a,null))}}}]);
