Pair this with its great cross-platform capabilities and easy integration with existing Java code, and you are left with no reason not to use Kotlin.

I originally only picked up D because it had the syntax of Java without being limited in the same ways as Java. However, I stayed because of the powerful metaprogramming capabilities. I only wish other languages had the power of D in regards to this aspect. I wish D had more support with external libraries, because it really is a very pleasant language to work in.

My favorite part of this show is near the ending where there is a consistent theme of humans becoming crueler and more like monsters while the literal monsters start gaining more emotions and becoming more human.

The gameplay is fun, the bosses are inventive and imaginative, and the story is captivating. When I first got the beetle item, I knew that buying this game was a good choice. I am also a fan of the fact that this game has a lot of content, especially when compared to other modern triple-A titles. I especially loved how vast and interesting each of the dungeons were. The only issue that I have with this game is that the motion controls were a bit hard to use and deal with.\"\n\t\t\t),\n\t\t\tnew CarouselItem(\n\t\t\t\t\"Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap\",\n\t\t\t\t\"https://cdn02.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/10_share_images/games_15/game_boy_advance_7/SI_GBA_TheLegendOfZeldaTheMinishCap_image1600w.jpg\",\n\t\t\t\t\"If someone says '2D game,' I think of this specific Legend of Zelda game. This game was a really fun time overall, and I really enjoyed the inventive dungeons and creative items. To me, the extra sword skill mechanics were really cool. I can still remember the feelings of satisfaction I got whenever I would accidentally stumble into one of the blade brothers after spending a long time exploring.

It seems to be universally loved, and all for good reason.

This is probably partially in part due to the fact that this game is the first videogame I have ever played in my life. For a platformer, this game really has it all: great level design, lots of thematic levels, really cool easter eggs, and cooperative play. However, I mostly just love this game because to me, it marks my introduction to gaming, and I am super glad that I was introduced with this title.\"\n\t\t\t),\n\t\t\tnew CarouselItem(\n\t\t\t\t\"Monster Hunter World\",\n\t\t\t\t\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/582010/header.jpg?t=1554771889\",\n\t\t\t\t\"While I have enjoyed many Monster Hunter games, this specific game is on my list of favorites due to how widespread it is. What really makes the Monster Hunter series special for me is that I can enjoy the games with others. This series of games really succeeds in making great cooperative multiplayer experiences.

I really appreciate how well Terraria handles power-scaling and mastery. Even though Terraria has hit critical success, I feel like it is still underrated. I do try to do my part though: I have gifted this game to many friends over the years just so we can have a ton of fun together. From fishing to exploring to fighting, this game really has it all. I have probably done dozens of run-throughs of this game, and each time is a completely different experience. My only issue with this game is its lack of good inventory management.\"\n\t\t\t),\n\t\t\tnew CarouselItem(\n\t\t\t\t\"Minecraft\",\n\t\t\t\t\"https://media.mojang.com/blog-image/2c34ca1217c7d95e76a6f8d646adf9208f78145a/blogmcnet.png\",\n\t\t\t\t\"Minecraft is a great and fun game. Everyone knows that already. However, with mods, the game is transformed into something completely different. It turns into a simulator where I must manage resources like time, energy, food, and materials with the utmost precision. However, I mostly enjoy Minecraft because it allows me to really do anything I want with anyone I want. This game has so much to do and allows for so many experiences, that it, despite its $30 cost, is really invaluable.\"\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t]\n\t),\n\tnew CarouselInformation(\n\t\t\"Movies\",\n\t\t\"I believe that movies are the first type of media that I have actively consumed in my life.

It sets up and then follows mostly consistent rules that then lead up to a large spectacle in the end. I like that this movie didn't shy away from having a complicated plot.

This movie was probably my favorite for a long time. I overall just have fond memories repeatedly watching this movie.

Probably due to this movie, Spider-Man has always been one of my favorite superheroes.\"\n\t\t\t),\n\t\t\tnew CarouselItem(\n\t\t\t\t\"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith\",\n\t\t\t\t\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/93/Star_Wars_Episode_III_Revenge_of_the_Sith_poster.jpg/220px-Star_Wars_Episode_III_Revenge_of_the_Sith_poster.jpg\",\n\t\t\t\t\"I remember watching this movie at least once every day for a period in my life. I really enjoy the Star Wars series, but I think this movie is especially good and holds up quite well.

I never really understood the movies when I was younger, and I just enjoyed the action.

Just from how much detail was put into this, I feel like this movie was made with a huge amount of love, care, and attention.\"\n\t\t\t),\n\t\t\tnew CarouselItem(\n\t\t\t\t\"Interstellar\",\n\t\t\t\t\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjdkOTU3MDktN2IxOS00OGEyLWFmMjktY2FiMmZkNWIyODZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_.jpg\",\n\t\t\t\t\"I feel like this movie is dense with plot information. That alone makes me enjoy this movie a lot. However, I enjoy this movie even more because I also think physics is cool. I really like that the producers of this film went the extra mile and hired experts just to get a few extra details right. I am able to overlook inaccuracies such as 'love being a fundamental force' due to their relevance to the story that is being told. The point of this movie is, after all, to tell a story first and foremost, and I think that that works out really well here.\"\n\t\t\t),\n\t\t\tnew CarouselItem(\n\t\t\t\t\"3 Idiots\",\n\t\t\t\t\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkyOGVjMGEtNmQzZi00NzFlLTlhOWQtODYyMDc2ZGJmYzFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_.jpg\",\n\t\t\t\t\"This movie is one of the few Bollywood movies that I really like.
