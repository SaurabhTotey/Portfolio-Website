My favorite part of this show is near the ending where there is a consistent theme of humans becoming crueler and more like monsters while the literal monsters start gaining more emotions and becoming more human.

I thought it was just another show where the protagonist gets transported into another world and has a great time. I couldn't be more wrong. Watching this show felt like I was watching torture taking place. The protagonist undergoes so much trouble, and the fact that the protagonist cannot tell anyone about the problems that he has to face alone is what really makes his situations feel unfair.

This show was extremely captivating the entire way through, and really knew how to make a great ending that tied everything together.

I am also a fan of the fact that this game has a lot of content, especially when compared to other modern triple-A titles. I especially loved how vast and interesting each of the dungeons were.

I am Saurabh Totey. Welcome to my little space on the internet to put whatever I want! I am a human male that is {new Date(new Date() - new Date(2000, 12, 5)).getFullYear() - 1970} years old. I currently live in Boulder, Colorado with my parents and my younger brother. In my free time, I spend a lot of my time trying to learn. My main passions are science and technology, but more specifically, I love learning all sorts of things such as programming, playing the piano, playing the cello, and modelling 3D objects. However, that isn't to say that I don't spend some of my free time doing other activities such as playing videogames or watching television series. I hope one day to make a great change in the world.</p>\n\t\t\t</ResponsiveContainer>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t<h2>Things I like</h2>\n\t\t\t<p>Select a category from the vertical list below to see my favorite things in that category.
