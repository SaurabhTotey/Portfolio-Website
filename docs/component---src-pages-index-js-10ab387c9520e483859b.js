I only wish other languages had the power of D in regards to this aspect. I wish D had more support with external libraries, because it really is a very pleasant language to work in.

It's been a great journey following each character through their respective story arcs. I really enjoyed seeing the twists and turns that the story took.

I love so many aspects of this show, such as how the story never takes a break and is one continuous series of events. Another aspect of this show that I love is how each character really does grow, even after they have achieved their supposed \"main goals\". My favorite part of this show is near the ending where there is a consistent theme of humans becoming crueler and more like monsters while the literal monsters start gaining more emotions and becoming more human.

I thought it was just another show where the protagonist gets transported into another world and has a great time. I couldn't be more wrong. Watching this show felt like I was watching torture taking place. The protagonist undergoes so much trouble, and the fact that the protagonist cannot tell anyone about the problems that he has to face alone is what really makes his situations feel unfair.
