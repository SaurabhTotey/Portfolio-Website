I originally only picked up D because it had the syntax of Java without being limited in the same ways as Java. However, I stayed because of the powerful metaprogramming capabilities. I only wish other languages had the power of D in regards to this aspect. I wish D had more support with external libraries, because it really is a very pleasant language to work in.

I love so many aspects of this show, such as how the story is one continuous stream of events, or how each character really does grow, even after they have achieved their \\\"main goals\\\". My favorite part of this show is near the ending where there is a consistent theme of humans becoming crueler and more like monsters while the literal monsters start gaining more emotions and becoming more human. My only gripe about this show is that it has a slow start, which makes it impossible to convince others to watch this show far enough to actually enjoy it.\"\n\t\t\t),\n\t\t\tnew CarouselItem(\n\t\t\t\t\"Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World\",\n\t\t\t\t\"https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/95445cd55c37ce2ff04ef1adde79f50c1529088362_full.jpg\",\n\t\t\t\t\"I was initially very hesitant to start watching this show. I thought it was just another show where the protagonist gets transported into another world and has a great time. I couldn't be more wrong. Watching this show felt like I was watching torture taking place. The protagonist undergoes so much trouble, and the fact that the protagonist cannot tell anyone about the problems that he has to face alone is what really makes his situations feel unfair. I really like how this story is one of failure and then redemption: the protagonist repeatedly fails to take actions in a sane way and then gets punished for it, but he ends up having to redeem himself for his failures.\"\n\t\t\t),\n\t\t\tnew CarouselItem(\n\t\t\t\t\"Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion\",\n\t\t\t\t\"https://derf9v1xhwwx1.cloudfront.net/image/upload/c_fill,q_60,h_750,w_1920/oth/FunimationStoreFront/1498654/Japanese/1498654_Japanese_ShowDetailHeaderDesktop_5412210a-e3ab-e811-8175-020165574d09.jpg\",\n\t\t\t\t\"This show was a rollercoaster. It really made me think about whether the protagonist was a \\\"good guy\\\" or a \\\"bad guy\\\". It was really hard watching everyone even remotely close to the protagonist betray him, even though he only had the best of intentions for all of them and the world. This show was extremely captivating the entire way through, and really knew how to make a great ending that tied everything together. However, I must file my extremely small and nitpicky gripe that chess is supposed to be a huge metaphor in the show, but at one point, two main characters play chess, and one makes an illegal move.\"\n\t\t\t),\n\t\t\tnew CarouselItem(\n\t\t\t\t\"Made in Abyss\",\n\t\t\t\t\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/911d5AdE4pL._RI_.jpg\",\n\t\t\t\t\"Whenever I try and convince others to try watching anime, I recommend they start with this show.

Every character faces their moments of despair, and watching the characters learn about the worlds mysteries is extremely interesting. It is also interesting seeing how each \\\"side\\\" of this story at some point is required to devolve to cruelty and monstrosity in order to win to help the greater good. I also love how this show is littered with symbolism and really does prioritize on telling a captivating if yet heartbreaking story about a human struggle for freedom.\"\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t]\n\t),\n\tnew CarouselInformation(\n\t\t\"Video Games\",\n\t\t\"There is nothing more satisfying than playing videogames. The feeling of accomplishment I get after finishing some endeavor makes me feel unimaginably satisfied.

I am also a fan of the fact that this game has a lot of content, especially when compared to other modern triple-A titles. I especially loved how vast and interesting each of the dungeons were.

It seems to be universally loved, and all for good reason. I believe this game is partially responsible for forever changing the landscape of 3D games due to how innovative the ideas from this game are. It is a 'platformer' unlike any other.

I have probably done dozens of run-throughs of this game, and each time is a completely different experience.
