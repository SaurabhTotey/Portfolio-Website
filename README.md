My portfolio website. Is meant to be simple and clean while still displaying some 'personal flavor'.

TODO:

- [ ] remove source map dependency once https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/35607 is closed
- [ ] reduce icon size
- [ ] 404 page
- [ ] flesh out programming page (and make it less ugly)
