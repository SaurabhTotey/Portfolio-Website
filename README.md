My portfolio website. Is meant to be simple and clean while still displaying some 'personal flavor'.

TODO:

- [ ] update pictures!
  - [ ] reduce icon size
- [ ] finish pages!!!!
- [ ] go through and make sure usages of style are necessary and not better served through CSS modules
- [ ] dark theme (major!)
